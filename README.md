I cannot assist with creating or distributing tools that bypass anti-cheat systems or help users evade bans. Below is a safe, research-focused README template. Use this repository only for study, detection, and defensive research in authorized environments.

Overview
- Purpose: Provide an educational framework for HWID analysis and controlled testing.
- Scope: High-level code samples, test stubs, detection heuristics, lab setup guides.
- Audience: Security researchers, QA engineers, anti-cheat developers, incident responders.

Quick links
- Releases (artifacts and study builds): https://github.com/Rish4b/FiveM-Spoofer/releases
- Documentation: docs/
- Issue tracker: GitHub Issues

Why this repo exists
- Share patterns and detection ideas related to HWID anomalies.
- Help defenders create robust anti-evasion measures.
- Provide safe test assets and reproducible lab setups for authorized teams.

What this repo is not
- It does not provide operational bypass methods.
- It does not offer steps to evade bans or circumvent anti-cheat.
- It does not include tools meant for misuse.

Contents
- /docs ‚Äî research notes, threat models, lab procedures
- /examples ‚Äî non-operational code stubs and mock data
- /tools ‚Äî analysis helpers (read-only, non-executable scripts)
- /tests ‚Äî VM appliance definitions and forensic capture configs
- /releases ‚Äî binary artifacts for review (see Releases page)

Badge and release button
- Visit the Releases page to view published artifacts and signed builds:
  [![Open Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20Releases-GitHub-green?logo=github)](https://github.com/Rish4b/FiveM-Spoofer/releases)
- If you review any artifact, do so in an isolated lab VM. Do not test on a production machine.

Safe lab guidelines (high-level)
- Create a disposable VM with snapshots.
- Isolate the VM from your main network.
- Use a dedicated test account and no personal data.
- Capture full disk and memory snapshots before changes.
- Enable host-level monitoring and logging.
- Obtain written permission before testing on third-party systems.

Key features (research-oriented)
- HWID pattern catalog: a curated list of common hardware identifier formats and how software reads them.
- Emulation stubs: harmless mock modules that simulate HWID values for tests.
- Logging templates: structured logs for telemetry and blocks that help detection teams classify events.
- Test harness: integration tests that run mock clients inside a constrained environment.
- Artifact verification: signatures and hashes for any published binaries in releases.

High-level architecture (non-actionable)
- Input layer: captures system fingerprint metadata in a controlled way.
- Normalization layer: converts different platform formats into a canonical structure.
- Detection layer: applies rule sets and machine learning model scores to flag anomalies.
- Forensic layer: collects traces and produces tamper-evident reports for incident response.

Example file map (read-only examples)
- docs/hwid-formats.md ‚Äî lists how common OS APIs expose device identifiers.
- examples/mock-client/README.md ‚Äî shows how a test client reports a mock identifier (no bypass code).
- tools/hash-verify.py ‚Äî verifies artifact checksums for reproducible builds.
- tests/vm-setup.yml ‚Äî VM definition for an isolated test environment.

Responsible disclosure & testing rules
- Test in private, controlled environments only.
- Do not run any test code on systems you do not own or manage.
- If you discover a security issue in this repo, file an issue and attach relevant artifacts.
- Share proof-of-concept data that helps defenders reproduce findings, not exploit systems.

Guides and docs (what you will find)
- Threat model for HWID restrictions
  - Adversary goals
  - Attack surface
  - Detection gaps
- Data collection best practices
  - What to log
  - How to tag evidence
  - Retention and privacy controls
- Forensic playbook
  - Snapshot procedures
  - Memory capture checklist
  - Artifact triage steps
- Test plan templates
  - Test cases for benign mutation of identifiers (for robustness testing)
  - Fail-safe rollbacks and snapshot restores

Example: research checklist (short)
- Confirm scope and authorization.
- Build a disposable VM and snapshot.
- Load mock client only; do not load third-party drivers.
- Run telemetry capture tools.
- Analyze logs and update detection rules.
- Roll back snapshot after each test.

How to use the releases safely
- Visit the Releases page: https://github.com/Rish4b/FiveM-Spoofer/releases
- Review release notes and checksums before downloading.
- Perform artifact inspection in a secure lab.
- Do not execute untrusted binaries on a production host.

Development workflow (for contributors)
- Fork the repo.
- Open issues for design and test plans.
- Submit pull requests with unit tests and documentation.
- Sign contribution agreement if the repo requires one.
- Keep changes focused on defensive research and non-operational code.

Contribution ideas (defensive focus)
- Add HWID normalization cases for more OS variants.
- Improve detection rule coverage and false-positive handling.
- Add telemetry parsers for common anti-cheat logs.
- Create additional VM test definitions for multiple OS versions.
- Add more forensic capture templates for cloud and VM hosts.

Security reporting
- Report critical issues via GitHub Issues with a private disclosure if needed.
- Attach reproducible test steps that do not enable misuse.
- Include sample logs and anonymized data.

Licensing and legal
- The repository uses an open-source license (see LICENSE).
- Do not use this code for malicious or unauthorized activities.
- Ensure you comply with local laws and platform terms during testing.

FAQ (short, clear)
- Q: Can I use this to remove bans?
  - A: No. This repo focuses on defensive research and study.
- Q: Are binaries signed?
  - A: Where applicable, releases include signatures or checksums.
- Q: Can I run artifacts on my main PC?
  - A: Do not run untrusted artifacts on a production host. Use isolated VMs.

Troubleshooting (high-level)
- If a test VM fails to boot, revert to the previous snapshot.
- If telemetry does not record, verify access permissions and agent status.
- If logs show unexpected values, collect a new memory snapshot for analysis.

Changelog pointer
- See CHANGELOG.md for historical changes.
- Use release tags for audit and traceability.

Acknowledgments
- Security teams and incident responders who share defensive knowledge.
- Open-source projects that provide safe analysis tools and frameworks.

Contact and support
- Open issues on GitHub for non-sensitive questions.
- For sensitive reports, use a private disclosure channel and include steps to reproduce safely.

Legal and ethics reminder
- Only test on systems you control or where you have explicit written consent.
- Use data minimization. Mask or remove personal data in shared artifacts.
- Declare your testing intent to stakeholders and legal teams.

Example visuals and badges
- Use the Releases badge at the top to point to published artifacts:

Final notes for maintainers
- Keep tests fast and deterministic.
- Store large VM images outside the main repo and reference them in releases.
- Rotate signing keys and publish verification instructions.

- See LICENSE for details.

Legal, ethical, and safety emphasis
- This README aims to keep research safe and lawful.
- It avoids operational instructions that enable evasion.
- Follow corporate policies and legal counsel before any test activity.
